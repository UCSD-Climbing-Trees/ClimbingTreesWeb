                <p class="about"> 
                    Hello there! I'm a software engineer currently studying at UCSD, where I have honed my skills in creating innovative and user-friendly websites. I am passionate about technology and love the creative process of building websites from scratch. From coding to design, I thrive on the challenge of bringing ideas to life in the digital world.
                    My time at UCSD has allowed me to dive deep into the world of software engineering, where I have learned to think critically and problem-solve in a fast-paced environment. One of my proudest moments was when I successfully built a website that not only met the needs of the client but also exceeded their expectations. The process of coding and designing that website was a true labor of love, and I am constantly looking for new ways to push the boundaries of what is possible in web development.
                    As a software engineer at UCSD, I am always on the lookout for new opportunities to collaborate with others and continue to grow and learn in the field. Whether it's learning a new coding language or experimenting with different design techniques, I am always eager to expand my skill set and take on new challenges. With a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites, I am excited to see where my journey in software engineering will take me next.
